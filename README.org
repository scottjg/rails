* Rails 2.3 with Security Patches

Sometimes the Rails core team will backport security patches to the 2.3 loadline, and
sometimes they won't.  This fork contains patches for a few security issues that were
not backported by the core team.

** Currently Applied Patches:

  - http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q2/449
  - http://seclists.org/oss-sec/2012/q2/503

** Notes

All of the changes are in the '2-3-security-patches' branch.

** Usage

Add this line to your Gemfile:

#+begin_src ruby
  gem "rails", :git => 'git://github.com/centro/rails.git', :branch => "2-3-security-patches"
#+end_src
