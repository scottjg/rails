## Gavel.ws for web-service accelerated negotiation.

Gavel.ws is a tool for auctioneering and the conduct of accelerated WIN.WIN.WIN negotiations from multiple actors using the most current information from multiple web-services.  Gavel.ws is about accelerating, optimizing and perfecting multi-party social negotiations. 

Gavel.ws is a fork of Rails, the web-application framework based on the [Model-View-Controller (MVC)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller)
pattern.

## Getting Started

0.  Understand the application domain.  Sketch out the various web/mobile/thing user-interface scenarios in order to think about the behaviors and needs for complementary web services that will drive the design of the application domain.

1.  Begin with end in mind -- use [BDD and TDD](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/software-testing/9781449372576/4dot-an-introduction-to-test-and-behavior-driven-development/_tdd_and_bdd_with_ruby_html) as you think about testable, executable specifications that document the "rules of the game" and define the features of your negotiation or auction application.

2.  Install the Gavel.ws base to create a starter app to begin developing the ecosystem of web services that your application will utlize. 

3.  Resist the urge to complexicate with lots of shiny junk.  Instead of just throwing web services at the wall to see what sticks, try to return to the necessary features of your domain per [test-driven infrastructure-as-code](http://my.safaribooksonline.com/book/software-engineering-and-development/software-testing/9781449372576/1dot-the-philosophy-of-test-driven-infrastructure/ch01_html)

4.  Follow best practices for clean, maintainable MVC code. Return to fundamentals. Review the basic RAILS guidelines as you develop and test and PRUNE your application. You may find the following resources handy:
